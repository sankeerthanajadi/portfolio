    <h1>The Four Colour Theorem</h1>
</header>

<main>
    <div class="top">
    
    <p><strong>Statement: All planar graphs are 4 or less colourable.</strong></p>

    <p>Explanation: The Four Colour Theorem states that no more than four colours are required to colour the regions of any map so that no two adjacent regions have the same colour.</p>
    </div>  
    <h2>Introduction and History</h2>
    <p>The origin of this problem traces back to 1852, October 23, by Francis Guthrie. While he was trying to colour the countries of England, he noticed that only four different colours were needed. This made him curious to wonder whether all maps can be coloured so. This theorem went unsolved for more than a century and vowed to be a stronger version of the five colour theorem. One of the earliest attempts was made by Alfred Kempe in 1879, which was widely acclaimed, but later proven incorrect by Percy Heawood. Many mathematicians made attempts to prove this problem, but there has always been a counterexample to disapprove the provided proof. The Four Colour Theorem was the first major theorem to be proved by a computer, which caused controversy among mathematicians and philosophers about the dependency on computers.</p>
    
    <p>Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken at the University of Illinois announced on June 21, 1976, that they had successfully proved the problem.</p>

    <h2>Let us explore Kempe's Solution</h2>
    <p>Suppose <em>v</em>, <em>e</em>, and <em>f</em> are the number of vertices, edges, and faces of a graph. Then by Euler's formula, it can be written as:</p>
    <p><strong>v - e + f = 2</strong></p>
    <p>Now, consider a case where each edge is shared by 2 faces and each face is bounded by 3 edges, it can be written as:</p>
    <p><strong>2e = 3f</strong></p>
    <p>By substituting <em>f</em> value in Euler's formula, we get:</p>
    <p><strong>3v - e = 6</strong></p>
    <p>It can also be written as:</p>
    <p><strong>6v - 2e = 12</strong></p>
    <p>If <em>V<sub>n</sub></em> is the number of vertices of degree <em>n</em> and <em>D</em> is the maximum degree of any vertex, the above equation can be written as:</p>
    <p><em><img src="4colour formula.svg" alt=""></em></p>

    <p>But since 12 > 0 and 6 − <em>i</em> ≤ 0 for all <em>i</em> ≥ 6, this demonstrates that there is at least one vertex of degree 5 or less.</p>

    <h2>Visualizing Kempe's Solution</h2>
    <p>Consider a region <em>X</em> surrounded by 4 regions in Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow. Now let us see how to colour region <em>X</em>.</p>
    <img id="graph" src="gr1.jpg" >

    <p>Since Green and Blue are different, we can come to 2 possible cases:</p>

    <h3>Case 1</h3>
    <p>Green and Blue vertices are not connected. The graph would look like this:</p>
    <p><em><img id="graph" src="gr2.jpg" ></em></p>
    <p>Since they are not connected, just swap the 2 colour vertices on either side.</p>
    <div id="graph2"><img id="graphs" src="gr3.jpg" >
        <img id="graphs" src="gr4.jpg" ></div>
    <p>After swapping, <em>X</em> vertex is connected to only blue-coloured vertices; therefore, <em>X</em> can be coloured as Green.</p>

    <h3>Case 2</h3>
    <p>Green and Blue vertices are connected. The graph would look like this:</p>
    <p><em><img id="graph" src="gr5.jpg" ></em></p>
    <p>If the swap operation is performed for the green and blue vertices, then we would end up having 2 adjacent vertices with the same colour. Since this isn't possible, let's look at the other pair, Yellow and Red. Yellow and Red vertices cannot be connected as it would violate the basic rule of the graph being planar. So, we are left with only 1 case where Yellow and Red are not connected. We can now apply Case 1 solution to these vertices.</p>
    <div id="2graph"><img id="graphs" src="gr6.jpg" >
        <img id="graphs" src="gr7.jpg" ></div>
    <p>Through this, Kempe proved that every planar graph is four or less colourable.</p>

    <h2>Counter Example that Disapproved Kempe's Solution</h2>
    <p>For this graph, if we apply Kempe's solution of swapping, we would end up in a situation where 2 same colours are adjacent to each other:</p>
    <p><em><img id="graph" src="gr8.png" ></em></p>
    <p>This graph is the counterexample that disproves Kempe's solution. Although Kempe's solution was not completely correct, it paved the way for other mathematicians to solve the theorem :)</p>
