        <p>The search for life beyond Earth has long fascinated scientists and space enthusiasts alike. Humans can then sharply narrow down the search for extraterrestrial life by searching only in places that have the conditions that Earth life requires: a source of energy, the presence of certain chemical compounds, and temperatures that allow liquid water to exist. One of the key prerequisites for life, as we know it, is the presence of liquid water. In 2024, space exploration made remarkable strides, discovering water on numerous celestial bodies and reinforcing the idea that liquid water may be more common than previously thought. When scientists and organizations search for extraterrestrial life, they aren't expecting to find advanced civilizations—rather, they focus on the possibility of discovering single-celled organisms, the fundamental building blocks of life.</p>

        <p>Europa is one of the largest moons of the gas giant Jupiter. It is one of the 90+ moons that Jupiter has and is considered the one with the most potential to persist life. But why? , among many celestial objects in the space why is it the focal point for many researchers and scientists. The answers lie beneath its cracked, orange-streaked surface, where mysteries abound.</p>

        <p>Jupiter's environmental conditions create a humongous magnetic field around Europa. It is 20 times stronger than that of Earth's. It on its own is harmless until the volcanic world Io is introduced. Io is yet another moon of Jupiter that is completely a volcanic disaster and bursts out lava and hot spread ions out of its surface into the space. It creates a massive radiative zone around Jupiter and even beyond Europa, making it very hard to get instruments working there. The ions interacts with the Jupiter's magnetic field and rotates in its orbits at speeds. </p>

        <p>During Galileo's mission by NASA, that observed the Jupiter and its moons, some interesting observations has been made. The magnetic fields on Jupiter changes due to misalignment with its geometric poles. This induces a magnetic field around Europa, from this we can state that there is a conductive layer/material that is supporting this process of reacting with Jupiter's magnetic field. </p>

        <p>Readings from Galileo suggest that the conductive layer lies close to the surface of Europa. What is this conductive layer, WATER??? Well, we'll see...</p>

        <p>Observing Europa's surface we see 1 thing i.e.; those reddish-brown lines/regions, and we can’t see 1 thing i.e.; the craters. The lines on Europa are caused due the tidal forces from the its's mother Jupiter. The force by Jupiter breaks the icy layer creating long-stipes. The craters are not visible due to the geological activity of the plates of Europa.</p>

        <p>The surface of Europa is completely icy. An experiment in JPL suggested that sea salt when bombarded with intense radiation turns reddish-brown. This suspects that there is a whole salt water sea beneath the thick water icy crust. Scientists estimate that it is about 100km deep and holds waters twice as earth. </p>

            But there is another fact which can get all this wrong. The fact that Jupiter is far far from sun(out-side the habitat zone), there is very less heat that reaches the Europa, so we would expect that surface and beneath it to be completely frozen. Here comes the interesting play of bodies to generate heat. If looked at the placement of the moons of Jupiter around it, the Io is the innermost around Jupiter then comes the Europa's orbit and surrounds it the Ganymede's orbit. While Ganymede finishes 1 orbit around Jupiter's, Europa's makes 2 orbits and Io makes 3. Due to this play, the Io pulls Europa closer to it in one side of the orbit and Ganymede stretches it out on the other side. Making a stronger force of Jupiter on it in one side and its orbit to be elliptical rather than an imperfect circle. This stretch of in and out, called as flexing generates heat on Europa that could keep the water in liquid state.
