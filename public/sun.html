    <p id="helio">Life as a heliophile is pure radiance.</p>

    <p>The position of sun in the milky way is near the Orion arm, between the Perseus and Sagittarius arms. It is located approx. 
        2800 light years from galactic Centre. It orbits the galaxy Centre with being tipped at angle of 60° as it drifts up and down. 
        It takes an approx. of 230 million years to complete one rotation around the galaxy Centre with a speed of 130 miles/sec.</p>

    <p>Our sun is a type of main sequence star as it generates energy by nuclear fusion H+H → He + energy. Every object in the space rotates 
        due to the gravitational pull of other bodies, sun also rotates due to the gravitational effect of its planets.</p>

    <p>Now let us understand the sleek complexity of color of the sun. Sun emits all the colors in the visible spectrum, from radio to gamma 
        rays, which, when combined, create the white light that we perceive. These colors (VIBGYOR) travel in the space to reach the earth, 
        as they reach the earth’s atmosphere, the short wavelength colors like green, blue, and purple are scattered by the earth’s atmosphere. 
        This is the reason sky appears to be blue. Only the long wavelengths like red, yellow, and orange can pass through and make it to our 
        eye. The black body curve[1] or plank function of this light is bell shaped. An interesting thing to know here is that when the 
        brightness of light is plotted against wavelength the highest peak is at violet and when plotted against frequency, the peak is 
        highest at infrared. This creates contradiction within itself. Another theory some people believe is that sun is a perfect black body 
        emitter, which it is not, and when brightness is plotted against wavelength it is green in color.</p>

    <p id="col">But truly our sun is white in color. PERIOD!!</p>

    <p>When sunlight is passed through a prism, it is separated into its component colors, forming a continuous spectrum. The spectrum shows a 
        distribution of colors from violet to red, with no prominent gaps. This continuous spectrum is a characteristic feature of a white light 
        source. The color temperature of sunlight, when measured on the Kelvin scale, is around 5,500 to 6,000 K. This places it in the range of 
        white light. Objects that emit light at this temperature are perceived as white. The sky is blue and snow is white these are moderately 
        because sunlight is white.</p>

    <p>The color of sun seen from space, from ISS[2], is white and today’s high-resolution cameras also capture the sun as white and partly 
        yellow. Also, hypothetically if the color of sun was red or green the world would be so different than what it is right now but if it was 
        blue then not much really would have changed as most of the blue light is scattered in the earth’s atmosphere.</p>

    <p>This hot heliosphere is the boss of our solar system that controls four terrestrial planets, two gas giants, two ice giants, candidates, 
        asteroid belt, comets, many icy bodies beyond Neptune and many moons.</p>
